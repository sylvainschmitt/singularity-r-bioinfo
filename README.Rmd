**R and bioinformatic packages**

This container includes:

* `R` 4.0.3
* `tidyverse` 1.3.0
* `Biostrings` 2.58.0
* `vcfR` 1.12.0
* `vroom` 1.3.2
* `csv2sql` 0.1.0
* `reshape2` 1.4.4
* `rmarkdown` 2.1.8
* `bookdown` 0.29
* `knitr` 1.4.0
* `bayesplot` 1.9.0
* `GGally` 2.1.2
* `viridis` 0.6.2

The `tidyverse` is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

[https://www.tidyverse.org/]

`Biostrings` is a memory efficient string containers, string matching algorithms, and other utilities, for fast manipulation of large biological sequences or sets of sequences.

[https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html]

The R package `vcfR` is a set of tools designed to read, write, manipulate and analyze VCF data.

[https://knausb.github.io/vcfR_documentation/]

`vroom` is the fastest delimited reader for R, 1.23 GB/sec.

[https://vroom.r-lib.org/]

The `csv2sql` is a wrapper to convert csv files to sql database. 

[https://github.com/kcf-jackson/csv2sql]

`reshape2` is an R package written by Hadley Wickham that makes it easy to transform data between wide and long formats.

[https://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape/]

`rmarkdonw` documents are fully reproducible. 
Use a productive notebook interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. 
Use multiple languages including R, Python, and SQL.

[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/]

The `bookdown` package is an open-source R package that facilitates writing books and long-form articles/reports with R Markdown.

[https://bookdown.org/]

Inspired by Sweave, the `knitr` package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report generation with R, 
and combine features in other add-on packages into one package 
(knitr â‰ˆ Sweave + cacheSweave + pgfSweave + weaver + animation::saveLatex() + R2HTML::RweaveHTML() + highlight::HighlightWeaveLatex() + 0.2 * brew + 0.1 * SweaveListingUtils + more).

[https://yihui.org/knitr/]

`bayesplot`  is an R package providing an extensive library of plotting functions for use after fitting Bayesian models (typically with MCMC).
The plots created by bayesplot are ggplot objects, which means that after a plot is created it can be further customized using various functions from the ggplot2 package.

[http://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/]

`GGally`  extends ggplot2 by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geoms with transformed data. 
Some of these functions include a pairwise plot matrix, a scatterplot plot matrix, a parallel coordinates plot, a survival plot, and several functions to plot networks.

[https://ggobi.github.io/ggally/]

`viridis`  color scales in makes plots that are pretty, better represents your data, easier to read by those with colorblindness, and print well in gray scale.

Singularity container based on the recipe: [`Singularity`](https://github.com/sylvainschmitt/singularity-r-bioinfo/blob/main/Singularity)

Image singularity (V>=3.3) is automatically test and built and pushed on the registry using 
[test.yml](https://github.com/sylvainschmitt/singularity-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml) &
[builder.yml](https://github.com/sylvainschmitt/singularity-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/builder.yml)



**build**:

```{bash, echo=T, eval=F}
